# NoGreedCookie
A Firefox extension that wipes out tracking cookies and third-party greed while preserving your logins. Blocks GitHub’s `_octo`, Verge’s 16+ trackers, Guardian’s `GU_mvt_id`—keeps FB functional. Privacy-first, no sneaky tracking allowed.

## Features
- **Tracker Blocking**: Kills `_ga`, `_octo`, `GU_mvt_id`, and more—stops ads and spies dead.
- **Third-Party Shield**: Axes scripts from DoubleClick, Google Analytics, Chartbeat—no external greed.
- **Session Safe**: Protects logins (e.g., 9 Kept on GitHub, 4 on FB)—no disruptions.
- **Auto-Updates**: Stays sharp via GitHub—freedom without hassle.
- **Lightweight**: Clears logs on tab close—zero bloat.

## Stats
- **GitHub**: 9 Kept, 1 Blocked (`_octo`).
- **Verge**: 1 Kept, 16 Blocked.
- **Facebook**: 4 Kept, 3 Blocked.
- **Guardian**: 1 Kept, 1 Blocked (`GU_mvt_id`).

Tested on Firefox ESR 128.8.0, March 31, 2025.

## Install
1. Download the signed [NoGreedCookie-v1.3.xpi].
2. Open Firefox: `about:addons > Gear icon > Install Add-on From File`.
3. Pick the `.xpi`—click “Proceed with caution” past the unsigned warning (ESR quirk, even with AMO signing).
4. Done—trackers gone, updates flow from GitHub!

## Why NoGreedCookie?
Tracking without consent is spying—end of story. This extension fights back: you decide what runs, not ad networks. Guardian can ask for support (fair game), but hidden greed gets shut down. GPLv3 keeps it free—forever.
