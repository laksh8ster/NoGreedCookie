# NoGreedCookie
A Firefox extension that kills tracking cookies and third-party greed while keeping your logins alive. Say goodbye to GitHub’s `_octo`, Verge’s 16+ trackers, and Guardian’s `GU_mvt_id`—all without breaking sites like Facebook. Privacy-first, no sneaky nonsense.

## Features
- **Tracker Blocking**: Axes `_ga`, `_octo`, `GU_mvt_id`, and more—stops ads and spies cold.
- **Third-Party Shield**: Blocks scripts from DoubleClick, Google Analytics, Chartbeat—no external greed.
- **Session Safe**: Keeps logins working (e.g., 9 Kept on GitHub, 4 on FB)—no interruptions.
- **Auto-Updates**: Stays fresh via GitHub—no manual reloads.
- **Lightweight**: Clears logs on tab close—zero bloat.

## Stats
- **GitHub**: 9 Kept, 1 Blocked (`_octo`).
- **Verge**: 1 Kept, 16 Blocked.
- **Facebook**: 4 Kept, 3 Blocked.
- **Guardian**: 1 Kept, 1 Blocked (`GU_mvt_id`).

Tested on Firefox ESR 128.8.0, March 31, 2025.

## Install
1. Download the code [NoGreedCookie-v1.3.
2. Open Firefox: `about:addons > Gear icon > Install Add-on From File`.
3. Select the `.xpi`—click “Proceed with caution” past the unsigned warning (ESR quirk, even with AMO signing).
4. Done—trackers blocked, updates roll in from GitHub!

## Why NoGreedCookie?
Tracking without clear consent is spying—plain and simple. This extension flips the script: you control what runs, not ad networks. Guardian can beg for cash (fair play), but hidden greed gets no love.
